    <h2>1. INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p>There are many natural compounds with wide scale of biological activities. Especially, there is a great interest in polyphenols, which have been studied for many years and are still very active domain of research because of their prospective use in health protection. Polyphenols are a wide class of substances, which contain over 8000 compounds, from those with simple structure (<i>e.g.</i> phenolic acids) to the polymeric substances like some condensed tannins.<sup>1, 2</sup> Flavonoids are very important and well known group of compounds with various pharmacological effects.<sup>3-7</sup> An important, but often neglected group of polyphenols are also tannins with lower molar weight. Since 1950, about 25 thousand papers, thereof approximately 1700 reviews, were dedicated to tannins in wider scale.</p>
    <p>In 1957, Bate-Smith and Swain defined plant tannins as water-soluble phenolic compounds having a molecular weight between 500 and 3000 Dalton.<sup>8</sup> Their characteristic properties include forming of insoluble complexes with proteins, polysaccharides, nucleic acids, or alkaloids. Within this general character, tannins exhibit number of various bioactivities, which are often related to their antioxidant activity. Tannins are classified into two major groups on the basis of their structure: the hydrolysable and the condensed tannins. Another group of tannins is formed by complex tannins.<sup>9</sup> Currently, phlorotannins, condensates of phloroglucinol which are present in sea algae, are also classified as tannins.<sup>9</sup> This review is focused on all groups of tannins, nevertheless more attention is given to cendensed tannins, because they are represented in nature more widely and are important components of human food, and on relatively new group of substances from seaweed — phlorotannins. This review continues the review study of the authors group published some time ago and extends the view of the very important group of natural substances that are commonly utilized in the diet.<sup>10, 11</sup></p>
    <p>Recently, series of review papers focused on these substances, especially hydrolysable tannins — compounds of medicinal and food plants,<sup>12</sup> chemical reactivity of C-glycosylated ellagitannins in relation to wine chemistry and biological activity,<sup>13</sup> synthesis of ellagitannins<sup>14</sup> and biological activities,<sup>15</sup> chemical-ecological aspects,<sup>16</sup> and pharmacological activity, or antinutritive factors in plants.<sup>17</sup> Some species of plants are interesting concerning their possible use: <i>e.g. Emblica offcinalis</i>,<sup>18, 19</sup> <i>Phyllanthus amarus</i>,<sup>20</sup> and <i>Terminalia arjuna</i>.<sup>21</sup></p>
    <h2>2. CLASSIFICATION OF TANNINS</h2>
    <h3>2.1. Hydrolysable Tannins</h3>
    <p>Hydrolysable tannins are compounds containing a central core of glucose or another polyol esterified with gallic acid, also called gallotannins, or with hexahydroxydiphenic acid, also called ellagitannins. Pentagalloylglucose (PGG) is a basic unit of the metabolism of hydrolysable tannins, from which other molecules are derived. Gallotannins consist of a central molecule, such as glucose, surrounded by gallic acid (<b>1</b>) units. Ellagitannins contain hexahydroxydiphenic acid (<b>2</b>), or its dilactone form, ellagic acid (<b>3</b>) (<b>Figure. 1</b>). The great variety in the structure of these compounds is due to the many possibilities in formation of oxidative linkages. Intermolecular oxidation reactions give rise to many oligomeric compounds having a molecular weight between 2000 and 5000 Dalton.<sup>22</sup></p>

    <p><b>Figure 1.</b> Characteristic structures of hydrolysable tannins: gallic acid (<b>1</b>); hexahydroxydiphenic acid (<b>2</b>); ellagic acid (<b>3</b>); pentagalloylglucose (<b>4</b>), the basic unit of hydrolysable tannins; 2-<i>O</i>-digalloyl-1,3,4,6-tetra-<i>O</i>-galoyl-β-D-glucopyranose (<b>5</b>), the example of gallotannin; tellimagradin II (<b>6</b>), the typical ellagitannin.</p>
    <p>Plants are able to biosynthesize gallotannins, ellagitannins, or form the mixture of both types of hydrolysable tannins. While condensed tannins are presented in many species of higher plants, presence of hydrolysable tannins is limited to Angiospermae, Dicotyledons. Gallic acid derivatives are presented in several families, <i>e.g. Ericaceae</i>, <i>Geraniaceae</i>, or <i>Fagaceae</i>. Ellagitannins are presented in subclasses <i>Hamamelidae</i>, <i>Dilleniidae</i>, and <i>Rosidae</i> species.<sup>23-25</sup></p>
    <h3>2.2. Condensed Tannins</h3>
    <p>Condensed tannins are oligomers or polymers composed of flavan-3-ol nuclei. They are also called proanthocyanidins, because they are decomposed to anthocyanidins in heated ethanol solutions (under acidic conditions). The most frequent basic units of condensed tannins are derivatives of flavan-3-ols: (+)-catechin (<b>7</b>), (-)-epicatechin (<b>8</b>), (+)-gallocatechin (<b>9</b>), and major polyphenols of green tea: (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC, <b>10</b>) and (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG, <b>11</b>) (<b>Figure. 2</b>). The structural diversity is caused by variation in hydroxylation pattern, stereochemistry at the three chiral centers, and the location and type of interflavan linkage. Furthermore, derivatisations as <i>O</i>-methylation, <i>C</i>- and <i>O</i>-glycosylation, and <i>O</i>-galloylation are frequently reported. Proanthocyanidins are classified according to their hydroxylation pattern into several subgroups, <i>e.g.</i> procyanidins (3,5,7,3',4'-OH), prodelphinidins (3,5,7,3',4',5'-OH), propelargonidins (3,5,7,4'-OH), profisetinidins (3,7,3',4'-OH), prorobinetinidins (3,7,3',4',5'-OH), proguibourtinidins (3,7,4'-OH), proteracacinidins (3,7,8,4'-OH), and promelacacinidins (3,7,8, 3',4'-OH).<sup>26, 27</sup></p>

    <p><b>Figure 2.</b> The most frequent structure units of condensed tannins: (+)-catechin (<b>7</b>); (-)-epicatechin (<b>8</b>); (+)-gallocatechin (<b>9</b>); (-)-epigallocatechin (<b>10</b>); (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (<b>11</b>).</p>
    <p>Proanthocyanidins of the B-type (dimeric) and C-type (trimeric) are characterized by single linked flavanyl units, usually between C-4 of the flavan-3-ol of the upper unit and C-6 or C-8 of the lower unit. Proanthocyanidins of the A-type possess an additional ether linkage between C-2 of the upper unit and a 7 or 5-OH of the lower unit (<b>Figure. 3</b>).<sup>26, 27</sup> Polymeres, composed of up to fifty monomers, are formed by the addition of more flavans. Especially polyepicatechins and copolymers of procyanidins and prodelphinidins are common.</p>

    <p>Proanthocyanidins have been isolated from many species of plants, and they are also important components of human food. The largest group of proanthocyanidins is formed by procyanidins. Procyanidin B-1 (<b>14</b>) is presented in grapefruit, sorghum, and cranberries, B-2 (<b>15</b>) in apples, cocoa beans, and cherries, B-3 (<b>16</b>) in strawberries and hops, and B-4 (<b>17</b>) in raspberries and blackberries.<sup>28, 29</sup> Well-known source of protoanthocyanidins is also red wine, green tea, cocoa and chocolate.<sup>30</sup></p>
    <h3>2.3. Phlorotannins</h3>
    <p>Widely presented group of polyphenolic substances based on phloroglucinol (<b>20</b>), phlorotannins, was found in marine brown algae (Phaeophyta). The phloroglucinol units are differently bound in these substances; they are considerably hydrophilic substances, with the relative molecular weight between 126 and 650 kDa, containing both phenyl- and phenoxy-groups. On the basis of the condensation of the units, they can be classified into four subgroups: fuhalols, phlorethols (phlorotannins with ether bond), fucophlorethols (with ether bond and phenyl connection) and eckols (with dibenzodioxin structural elements). The basic structures are depicted on <b>Figure. 4</b>. These substances were found especially in <i>Ecklonia cava</i>, <i>Ecklonia stolonifera</i>, <i>Ecklonia kurome</i>, <i>Eisenia bicyclis</i>, <i>Ishige okamurae</i>, <i>Sargassum thunbergii</i>, <i>Hizikia fusiformis</i>, <i>Undaria pinnatifida</i>, and <i>Laminaria japonica</i>.<sup>9</sup></p>
    <img src='Figures/Fig4.png' width='333' />
    <p><b>Figure 4.</b> Basic structures of phlorotannins isolated from seaweeds: phloroglucinol (<b>20</b>), eckol (<b>21</b>), fucodiphloroethol, G (<b>22</b>), phlorofucofuroeckol A (<b>23</b>), 7-phloroeckol (<b>24</b>), dieckol (<b>25</b>), and 6,6'-bieckol (<b>26</b>).</p>
    <p>It is very interesting and recently developing group of polyphenolics, which biological activities are just revealed; since the beginning of their study, about 300 papers were published, thereof 30 reviews, since 2006 about 170 papers (thereof about 20 reviews). They posses anti-cancerogenic effect,<sup>31</sup> antioxidant,<sup>9</sup> inhibit some enzyme systems,<sup>9</sup> show antibacterial and anti-HIV activity,<sup>9</sup> are radioprotective<sup>9</sup> and with antiallergic effects.<sup>9</sup> Many effects are similar to the effects of tannins isolated from higher plants, especially in case of polyphenolic substances of constant chemical composition.<sup>12</sup> It appears, that these substances will become an important component in the production of food supplements and medical foods.<sup>31-35</sup> They can be used also in cosmetics.<sup>36</sup> Phlorotannins are still waiting for their overall evaluation.</p>
    <h2>3. ABSORPTION AND METABOLISM OF TANNINS</h2>
    <p>It was assumed for a long time that tannins are not absorbed due to their high molecular weight and their ability to form insoluble complexes with components of food, such as amino acids and proteins. Though there are some studies which confirm that the absorption of tannins is higher than it was assumed there are still many questions about their biological availability.<sup>37</sup> Generally, absorption of tannins decreases with the increasing polymerization degree.</p>
    <p>It was found that dimeric and trimeric procyanidins are absorbed by intestinal epithelium without any considerable limitations. Caco-2 cell line was used as an <i>in vitro</i> model of intestinal epithelium. The absorption decrease with further polymerization, and the transport of hexamers did not proceed.<sup>38</sup></p>
    <p>The <i>in vitro</i> study which dealt with the stability of procyanidins in acidic environment, as found in the gastric milieu, stated that high-molecular substances are fragmented to absorbable monomers and dimers.<sup>39</sup> Another study claims that higher procyanidins are not degraded in stomach environment of six healthy volunteers, and only original monomers and dimers are absorbed.<sup>40</sup> This discrepance could be interpreted in view of various characters of tested proanthocyanidins: some compounds can be more disposed to degradation than others.</p>
    <p>According to one study epicatechin is the primary bioavailable form of procyanidin dimers B-2 (<b>15</b>) and B-5 after perfusion of isolated small intestine, while other study in rats arrived at a conclusion that procyanidin B-2 (<b>15</b>) is absorbed and excreted predominantly unmodified and is metabolized only partly.<sup>41, 42</sup> These results show that quantitative composition of a tested mixture and also the type of used biological model affect the process of absorption.</p>
    <p>Human intestinal microflora plays an important role in metabolization of tannins. It is known that the part of non-absorbed tannins is degraded <i>in vitro</i> by colonic microflora to various phenolic products, which can be absorbed and participate on various pharmacological effects.<sup>43</sup> Aura presents an instructive view on microbial metabolism of dietary tannins in the colon: proanthocyanidins, which enter to the colon, are not much metabolized to phenolic acids. They are degraded by colon bacteria to various derivatives of phenylvaleric, phenylpropionic, phenylacetic and benzoic acid with different rate of hydroxylation. The rate of polymeration is very important: The higher polymeration the lower is the rate of metabolization in the colon. Ellagitannins are substances with big molecule and relatively limited biological availability. They are degraded to ellagic acid (<b>3</b>) which is excreted by urine and feces: in the colon, two lactones (urolithin A and B), which are conjugated with glucuronic acid, are formed.<sup>44</sup> The detailed data about biological availability, metabolism and biological activity of ellagic acid (<b>3</b>) and similar substances presented in diet was presented recently.<sup>45</sup> Non-absorbed high-molecular tannins and tannin-protein complexes have also an important role for protection of intestinal tract because they keep their antioxidant activity.<sup>46</sup> Although tannins are able to act against various pathophysiological processes, mechanism of the effect of many of these interactions is not known. However, the last studies show that these substances bond with cell membranes and biochemical reactions are subsequently set off. Solid-State NMR Spectroscopy begins to be used for the study of these interactions and clarification of possible activity.<sup>47</sup></p>
    <p>No details about the bioavailability of phlorotannins have been presented yet.</p>
    <h2>4. BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY</h2>
    <h3>4.1. ROS and Antioxidants</h3>
    <p>Antioxidants are defined like substances that, when present at low concentrations compared to those of an oxidizable substrate, significantly delays or prevent oxidation of that substrate. Recently, great attention has been given to antioxidant agents by reason of their medical use. It is given by association of many human diseases with oxidative stress. Free radicals play an important role in pathogenesis of ageing, various cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes mellitus or cancer. For example, in the radiation-induced carcinogenesis, highly reactive hydroxyl radicals are recognized as primary cause of the disease, whereas in diseases like atherosclerosis or rheumatoid arthritis, an oxidative stress is not the inciting agent, but supports their pathology.<sup>26, 48-50</sup></p>
    <p>Primarily, free radicals play an important physiological role, for example, they are mediators of energy transfer, immunity defense factors, or signal molecules of cell regulation. In special conditions they may become undesirable and injure the organism. For maintenance of the redox balance and prevention of increased formation of free radicals, organism uses some mechanisms, such as scavenging of free radicals, prevention of new formation through regulation of enzymes, which form them, support of antioxidant enzymes, or inactivation of transition metals which support formation of free radicals.<sup>51</sup></p>
    <p>Secondary plant metabolites, such as flavonoids or tannins, can be also involved in complex system of antioxidant defense. The basic mechanisms of antioxidant activity of tannins are free radical scavenging activity, chelation of transition metals and inhibition of prooxidative enzymes.</p>
    <h3>4.2. Free Radical Scavenging Activity</h3>
    <p>The basic concept of free radical scavenging activity of polyphenols, including tannins, is the ability of antioxidant to donate electron to a free radical and produce a more stable and therefore less harmful radical structure. DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)hydrazyl) or ABTS<sup>+</sup> ((2,2-azinobis)3-ethyl-2,3-dihydrobenzothiazol-6-sulphonic acid) radicals are often used for <i>in vitro</i> determination of free radical scavenging activity.<sup>52, 53</sup> A number of tested condensed and hydrolysable tannins scavenged these radicals.<sup>54-58</sup> It is possible to found it beneficial that this biological effect was found in plants used as a component of the diet, <i>e.g.</i> green lentil (<i>Lens culinaris</i>, seeds),<sup>59</sup> mangosteen fruit (<i>Garcinia mangostana</i>, rind),<sup>60</sup> peanut (<i>Arachis hypogea</i>, skin),<sup>61</sup> pomegranate (<i>Punica granatum</i>, peel),<sup>62</sup> chilean blackberry (<i>Aristotelia chilensis</i>, fruit),<sup>63</sup> pecan (<i>Carya illinoinensis</i>, shell),<sup>64</sup> and acai (<i>Euterpe oleracea</i>, fruit).<sup>65</sup> Out of other radicals, free radical scavenging activity against superoxide radical,<sup>66</sup> hydroxyl radical,<sup>67, 68</sup> and peroxyl or nitric oxide (NO)<sup>69, 70</sup> was determinated.<sup>71, 72</sup></p>
    <p>Generally, it applies to proanthocyanidins that scavenging activity increases with the number of hydroxyls, especially if they are at ortho position on benzen nucleus and if gallic acid is introduced. The activity is also influenced by the size of molecule; it increases from monomers to trimers, afterwards it decreases.<sup>55, 56</sup></p>
    <p>The comparison of antioxidant activities of B-type procyanidins showed ambiguous results. One study found that procyanidin B-2 (<b>15</b>) is more active than B-3 and B-5 in DPPH assay, while other study did not prove any differences in ABTS<sup>+</sup> scavenging activity of six different B-type procyanidins.<sup>54, 56</sup> In superoxide radical scavenging assay, procyanidins B-1 (<b>14</b>) and B-3 (<b>16</b>) showed similar scavenging activity.<sup>66</sup> These differences are not surprising because one compound can act differently against different radicals.</p>
    <p>Tannins, due to their higher molecular weight and high degree of hydroxylation of aromatic rings, show high antioxidant potential. In comparison to <i>in vitro</i> antioxidant activity of various types of polyphenols, dimeric procyanidins are the most active on the basis of scavenging of ABTS<sup>+</sup> radical, hypochlorous acid, or in FRAP test for the evaluation of reducing power. Dimeric procyanidines were followed by flavanols, flavonols, hydroxycinnamic acids and simple phenolic acids.<sup>73</sup></p>
    <p>It was found that, unlike other phenolic antioxidants, procyanidins might not show prooxidative activity. Quercetin and other flavon(ol)s form <i>o</i>-quinone structures in quenching reactions that may act as prooxidants in further redox reactions. While the study, which used electron spin resonance technique (ESR) which dealt with mechanism of antioxidant activity of hydrolysable and condensed tannins, showed the contrary. <i>o</i>-Quinones of proanthocyanidins formed after reaction with radical are subjected to subsequent nucleophilic addition reactions and as a result more complicated structures are formed, which keep great number of hydroxyl groups and thereby also their antioxidant activity (<b>Figure. 5</b>). From this point of view proanthocyanidins are better antioxidants than monomeric flavon(ol)s. The similar experiments with hydrolysable tannins were not so unambiguous.<sup>74</sup> Another study which evaluated anti- and pooxidation properties of gallic and ellagic acid (<b>3</b>) and tannin (tannic acid) according to the DNA injury in mussels <i>Unio tumidus</i> cells found that high concentrations of these substances injured DNA and showed prooxidant activity.<sup>75</sup></p>

    <p><b>Figure 5.</b> Polyphenolic reaction of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG, <b>11</b>).</p>
    <p>Oligomeric procyanidins (B-1 (<b>14</b>), B-3 (<b>16</b>), and others) and phenolic monomers (catechin, epicatechin, and flavonoid taxifolin) are the main bioactive compounds of standardized <i>Pinus maritima</i> bark extract (Pycnogenol<sup>®</sup>). This pine originated from south part of France and in many countries is used as a material for production of the mixture known as Pycnogenol<sup>®</sup>, which is the principal component of dietetic preparations for cardiovascular system protection. It causes vasodilation effect, inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), or increase in capillary permeability. Pine bark extract also contains phenolic acids (such as caffeic, ferulic, and <i>p</i>-hydroxybenzoic acids) as minor constituents and glycosylation products, <i>e.g.</i> glucopyranosyl derivatives of either flavonoids or phenolic acids as minute constituents. Recently, the great scientific attention regards the medicinal use of this extract. Studies indicate that Pycnogenol<sup>®</sup> components are highly bioavailable. The complex extract exhibits higher biological activity than isolated substances, which means that the constituents act synergistically. The extract has strong free radical scavenging activity against RNOS. The procyanidins contribute significantly to the ESR free radical signal. Pycnogenol<sup>®</sup> modulates NO metabolism in activated macrophages by quenching the NO radical and inhibiting both iNOS mRNA experession and iNOS activity. Oligomeric procyanidins highly participate on this high radical scavenging activity. The ability to regenerate ascorbyl radical and protect endogenous vitamin E and glutathione (GSH) against oxidative damage also support the complex antioxidant properties of Pycnogenol<sup>®</sup>.<sup>76</sup></p>
    <p>The antioxidant (free radical scavenging) activity is also demonstrated by phlorotannins, <i>e.g.</i> from <i>Ascophyllum nodosum</i>,<sup>77</sup> some species of genus <i>Eisenia</i>,<sup>78, 79</sup> <i>Ecklonia</i>,<sup>78</sup> and many others.</p>
    <p>Recently, it is clear that <i>sensu lato</i> antioxidant activity synergizes with some other biological effects, as it was proved in many plant extracts containing tannins, <i>e.g.</i> they participate favorably in chemoprotective (hepatoprotective) effects (<i>Boerhaavia diffusa</i>),<sup>80</sup> antimicrobial activity (<i>Camellia sinensis</i>),<sup>81</sup> decrease of genotoxicity (<i>Quercus resinosa</i>)<sup>82</sup> and abrogates oxidative stress-induced functional alterations in murine macrophages (<i>Quercus infectoria</i>).<sup>83</sup></p>
    <p>The attention is also paid to oligomers of procyanidins concerning the synthetic point of view - especially structure activity relationships (DPPH radical scavenging activity and Maillard reaction inhibitory activity).<sup>84</sup></p>
    <h3>4.3. Chelation of Transition Metals</h3>
    <p>It is known for a long time, that polyphenolics,<sup>85</sup> including tannins<sup>86</sup> are able to bond cations of transition metals and act as protective agents against progression of some diseases, <i>e.g.</i> Alzheimer's or Parkinson´s disease.<sup>87</sup></p>
    <p>The transition metals, especially iron, mangan and copper perform many functions in human organism. For example, they play an important physiological role like cofactors of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase or glutathione peroxidase. They are usually bound to proteins, such as ferritin or caeuroplasmin.<sup>88</sup> When they occur separately, they can catalyze the radical reactions. The typical example of these reactions is well known Fenton reaction:<sup>89</sup></p>
